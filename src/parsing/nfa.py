# the ThompsonsThompsonsNFA class is a class for representing a Non Determistic Finite Automata

#
# initial: The initial state of the automata (LMAO redundant but still)
# accept: in a Normal NFA we can have many accept's states, but if we follow the Thompsons algorithm, 
# we end up we just one of them
